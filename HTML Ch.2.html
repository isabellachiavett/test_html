    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the
      page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure
      of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or
      lower-level headings)
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading?
      Probably not. Too much info/text now.
    </p>
    <span><strong>right?</strong></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>And Another Sub-Heading</h3>
    <p>
      More headings?? Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do
      now. Let's use a proper tag.
    </p>
    <h4>Yet Another Sub-Heading</h4>
    <p>
      That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. You know
      what to do now. Make this <span><strong>WORD</strong></span> strong aka
      bold. Give it a proper tag!
